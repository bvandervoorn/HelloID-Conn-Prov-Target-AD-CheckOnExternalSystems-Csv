## Example 1
In this example SamAccountName is used in these other attributes: 'CommonName','AdditionalFields.proxyAddresses','AdditionalFields.userPrincipalName','AdditionalFields.mail'.
So when SamAccountName is not unique, all these fields need to be iterated to be the same as SamAccountName. 

## Example 2
In this example only SamAccountName needs to be checked and iterated.
